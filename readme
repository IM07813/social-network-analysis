This code is an example of Social Network Analysis (SNA) applied to a dataset of email communications. 
The dataset, EN_EMAILS_Enron_10k-1.csv, contains information about the email interactions between users. 
The main objective is to analyse the relationships between users and calculate various centrality metrics like PageRank,
Betweenness Centrality, and the ratio of In-degree to Out-degree. The code also involves community detection using
Greedy Modularity Maximization and visualization of the network graph and the calculated metrics using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
