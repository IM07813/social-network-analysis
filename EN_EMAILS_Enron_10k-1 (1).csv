Now I see how you guys have been winning all of your games - through 
cheating.  You are supposed to have at least one player on IR each week.  A 
designated IR player cannot play.  There are no IR moves during the week.  
That means that at least one person on your team should score no points each 
week.

Georgeanne told Eugenio about another Enron stock swap.  This one is very 
large, with an exposure to 12 million shares (though it is a little hedged by 
the Phantom swap).  As a result, the VaR for non-trading securities increased 
from an average $6 to $39 million.

We also recalculated Merchant Asset VaR.

As of right now, I'm available, but with the crisis in California, I might be 
called away.  At this point, though, I'm clear and will plan on meeting.  My 
apologies for the uncertainty.

Here's the last shot of Hef's present to Cameron when she was born.  I think
you all have seen it at the Dome at some point in your visits there.  It
lasted almost thirty-two years.

I recommend reading CAISO's response.  This letter was reported in last 
week's trade press.

I am told that BPA does not consider this letter confidential even though it 
is labeled as such by CAISO.

Many of the  CAISO backpedal statements made re: claims of strategic 
bidding would apply equally to other importers.

continue to support direct access. Brown is the swing vote on the CPUC. That 
would mean that there are still 3 votes for direct access and only two votes 
to kill it.

ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEDGE -- PREPARED FOR FERC SETTLEMENT DISCUSSIONS

Here are my comments -- it looks pretty good.  I was hampered by not knowing 
the objective of the piece.  I made changes to fix inaccuracies or 
inferences.  I also have notes/comments/rationales shown in boldface.

There are two articles in today's edition of the Tucson Citizen regarding the 
above referenced.  Apparently APS has contracted with the University of 
Arizona to do an estimated $5.5-6 million in business saving the university

Jeff,

Here are some suggestions:

11 Sonoma Patio
3 Walla Vista         These 3 are nearby each other-
4 Sacramento Patio  <--this one has hot tub-all have lots
of patio space.
19 Brighton Avenue   <--In Bolinas, but it would fit
everyone in one house.

I will not be in on Wednesday or Thursday, so ask for Sarah if you call
then.

Thanks,

Hey, I know it's a pain, but I think there would be value in getting together 
(if folks are available) on Thursday evening from 7-10 with (lots of) beer 
and pizza and grind through the finance case.  We can do it at my apartment, 
or anywhere else you folks would like to do it.  Thoughts?";"elly-fairisaac-com";973529950000;20;20;20;20;"jeff-dasovich

Hi Mary:
Well, the problem is likely just that I'm dense.  I log in, click on deferral 
and find a description of what one needs to do (i.e., fill out the form), but 
I've surfed around the site a bit and can't seem to find the form.  Am I 
(probably) missing something?  Thanks a bunch.

Quick question.  Does the lease-buy-back free up $50M of funds for 1987?  
Mark, is that captured in the 1987 cash flows?  Don't think that should

we captured it.

Heard through Bugg your in SF now. You should rethink coming up to Kelowna

Thinking of going to the bay area to visit some friends sometime soon. Send

Any good stock ideas? Check out MSIA on the Nasdaq OTC board. This could be a

averaged around the 3366 that they want to bring the volume down to. Let me

Daren,
I have HPL Resources meter 988055 wasn't sure if I should path this for April 
3rd's deal change.
and I have Mobil Oil meter 981040 that I pathed on the first for 30,000 that 
change to 50,000 for the 3rd.
I didn't path them since they are industrials and Aimee's notes told me to 
path Industrials -
except for a few exceptions.
Thanks, Julie

We do not have a demand fee for the Feb 2001 Tenaska IV sale, deal 384258.  
Can you please put this in so I can bill?  From your spreadsheet, it looks 
like it needs to be $2,291,888.83, but you can verify.  I subtracted the 
agency fee from the Tenaska IV receipt number, since we already have that 
booked.

On the above mentioned dates, there was no nomination at the Enerfin meter.

6/3/99 and 6/8/99 revealed activity for ENA (202K).  Can the deal be extended 
for 6/4 (548 dec.) and 6/9 (40 dec.) to cover this flow so that Volume

I am having trouble pulling in the demand charge for 6/00 on deal 157278 for 
$1,129.09.  The only thing that is different from May is that the demand

Here is a short subset of 10-minute records containing the extreme

The graphs attached are formatted the same as the sample set I sent you 
earlier. As of today, Desert Sky 10-minute data has not been uploaded for

attached is the first overview of the SQL interface.

At the moment I only use the data from the files in the ParkData directory.

If we change the plant version, we can use further data.


Please, check the field assignment.





Best regards,

In investigating an apparent error with the pressure sensors at Montfort I 
have discovered two things.

1. Pressure reading are stored in the paradox files in milibars.
2. The pressure sensor at Montfort has been malfunction since it was 
installed, but not replaced pending someone signing a P.O. for the 
replacement sensor.

Catherine,

Could (Would) you do me the favor of arranging flight reservations for Mark 
Fisher to travel to Mill Run PA on Wednesday next week?  He will need a car 
and hotel reservations in addition to his flight arrangements.  His return 
flight would be Friday morning.

Thanks for your reply Mark.  Your observation is interesting.  I had not 
thought of that.  The y intercept of a linear regression can be easily set to 
zero in excel.  It's one of the trend line options.

Have a good weekend,

Greetings,

To my best memory, the Systems Performance Group is cost center 267.  I 
picked up my American Funds retirement packet tonight from the front desk, 
and the sticker on the front states cost center 269.  Have we changed cost 
centers or is this a typo?

Mark,

I checked the sums with what was sent on 6/25 using the 10.4% correction.  
They are not the same.  I will inform AEP that we will reprocess these 
figures.  Maybe we can reprocess overnight on my and your machine next week 
rather than wait until the June result.

Please put the Transco Sims deal #289172 on the morning sheet.

The total volume we need to deliver to this deal is 480,000 dth and we may 
deliver 18,000 dt - 22,000 dt per day.  We currently have 20,000 dt in the

I shuffled the storage deal tickets (deal 268090 and 268093) around for 
June.  We are injecting more gas at the beginning of the month and less in 
the end of the month.

On Tuesday, our net injection goes to 29,687 dth.
On Sat, 19th, our net injection drops to 2,204 dth.

This keeps us at our 60% max storage balance on 6/30/2000.";"icia-perkins";959864530000;60;60;60;60;"chris-germany

I realilzed we may be focusing a little too much on malin and leaving some 
rocks unturned.  I talked to Sempra and we can use them as a sleeve for 
different counterparties that we don't not have a credit agreement 
established with(i.e. metrowater @ mead and others).  They generally charge 
$2.

Hey!

There is a new spreadsheet with all our BPA Account numbers summarised in a 
PIVOT table. The file is in P:RealTime/RT BPA ACCOUNT #'S. By filtering by 
individual source, sink , Type (Firm / Non Firm) you will get the account 
number. Make sure all is not selected in any of the fields as this can give 
you an invalid account number.

Group,

I have created some new procedures for the SAR, CARP, and Enpower to CAPS  
mainly to make it easier for the newer members of the group to run the 
reports at night. They are fairly detailed and are tested once but I would 
appreciate any further feedback from you.

These procedures are located in P: /Real Time/ Reports

hope this helps,

team, 

Do not send any HA 24 schedules that you do not intend to send.  In other 
words, remove all schedules that are not the specific ones you want to send.  
We have been sending zero schedule when we don't want to be.  If we go back 
to only sending our HA 24 schedules, we can avoid this problem.

Just a reminder that when entering a wheel, the Interchange ID must be the 
same for the import and export.  When the Import is labeled as EPMI_CISO_** 
and the Export as CISO_EPMI_**, the ISO views these as unique imports and 
exports.  They will not be linked together for a wheel, thus causing 
ancillary services charges to occur.

Michael:

I think it is an excellent idea to keep count of the number of ISDAs we have 
as a way of focusing attention on our progress.  I think it may be a good 
idea to get a paralegal secondee from A&O or Linklaiters.  That secondee 
could then help with overflow work after a return to the firm.

John,

LIG is the only pipe that delivers to the LUS generation station and 
therefore does not have a transportation rate.  If you wanted to transport to 
the TransLa/LIG interconnect, you would need to get a rate from LIG.  The 
contact at LIG is Bud Elkins at 832-397-3405.

Can you find out the published rate on LIG without calling them?";"hn-hodge";981310090000;0;0;0;0;"phil-demoes

Attached is the Coleman Purchase Agreement  --   I have included their wiring 
instructions which I just received.  After Howard Hertzburg calls you, we can 
incorporate his comments, if any, and generate final drafts.

Thanks

Dan,
Could you email your fax number.  I will then send a copy of the BancFirst
Mortgage referenced in my previous email.
The JOA Recording Supplement is apparently in route from the Campbell County

I will forward a copy to you upon receipt.

I agree with you on points 2,5,8.  just delete them in the confirm.

With regards to point 2. As long as the language reflects that best efforts 
are taken to buy/sell gas at Daily Index when required and then it goes to a 
fixed price I am fine with it.

Anthony, in reply to your voicemail that you can't find the guarantees, 
you've got to have them somewhere there.  Maybe they're with some old Margie 
Wright files.  But neither Legal nor Credit would keep the original 
guarantees, so they've got to be somewhere there.";"lissa-graves";931261270000;10;10;10;10;"tana-jones

don't have trading relationships with any of these CPs, and none of them are 
on the lists of FERC authorized power marketers.

Yannis,

I have looked at the outline of the proposed course and
find that practically all the topics of the program are the
staple of what we do every day. I don't think Research  should spend 
money for this class.

If we want to establish a relationship, we can easily do it
by asking him to work on a research project.

Enron about an offer for summer employment.  I do have other offers with 
other energy companies that I must respond to this week.  Could you let me 
know as soon as possible if an offer will be made to me.

Hi Grant,
As requested I have sent a quick summary document giving an up-to-date 
description of the VaR model.
I may well have missed some points but Cantekin has worked closely with me on 
any changes so it is worth 
consulting him on any details I have missed.

Thanks

I know you're very busy, so you might not have heard this ...

Apparently, the Board will meet this week to approve the sale of *all* of 
Enron International's assets to a member of hte Saudi royal family, the same 
Prince who once invested heavily in Citicorp to bail it out.

The source of this is someone I trust.

I looked into the proposed tax cut by George W. Bush.  On his website he 
proposes a $460 billion tax cut over five years. 
 The $213 billion energy tax imposed  from 1999 to 2001 by higher energy 
prices, is roughly half of Bush's proposed tax cut.

I just realized that you do have financial desk excluding futures on report.

Get rid of the other financial desk and when you aggregate it exclude the futures trades.

If possible, can we reschedule our meeting from Wednesday (10/4) to tomorrow 
at 1pm since I have completed TW invoice review this afternoon.  I am hoping 
to possibly take Wednesday off if I can shift my meetings.  Let me know if 
there's a conflict.

This week, make sure you call all your customers (if you haven't already 
spoken with them) and discuss the non-binding open season.  Answer any 
questions they might have, and reiterate the response deadline.  See if you

Could you replace our recent posting on the EBB with the attached document.  
We've just corrected the name of Enron Oil & Gas to EOG Resources.  I 
don't think it's necessary to put Revised or anything on it, unless we have 
to.  I'd just like to replace it (or if you can go in and make that change,

Hi Karen,

Could I get a copy of whatever the latest version is of the GE consent for 
Pastoria?  We have a potential deal coming up to move some frames out of 
TurboPark, so I would like to see the current state-of-the-are version.

Thanks,

Ben,

I made a minor adjustment to the LOI re: exclusivity.    



Policy states that any time we sign up to exclusivity we are supposed to get 
it approved by Mark Metts, Tim Detmering and the CEO of the affected business 
unit.  Seems a little silly in this case, but it can't hurt. (yes, I know we 
didn't do it with the turbine stuff)

Turbine Team,

For future reference we should add in the put/call language (similiar to the 
language in 6.2 (c) of the Intergen deal) which allows Enron to put the 
equity to the buyer at any time GE consents.  We should soften the approval 
rights of the purchaser.

My suggestion is that you capture the change order with change order #1 for 
PSCO's break out contract.  If it needs to be paid before year end (which it 
probably does) you can put a payment date of December 20th, and it will be 
paid out of TurboPark.  This approach has been discussed with Lee Johnson at

there is no implied duty of good faith and fair dealing under current case

Mark and I are confirmed with flights.  Chris is not coming.  Where are you 
staying, any good hotel ideas.  Mark had a room for 1 night by the stadium 
but now i think we will fly in on Tues early afternoon and mess around Miami 
and therefor  may want to stay closer to the city.  Any thoughts?  When are

I checke our Historical Caps for these deals and i am certain that we bought from and sold to Reliant (NES1) for hour ending 11.  If this were not the case
we would have failed phase 2 with the ISO.  I am searching my notes for the price and whom I spoke with at Reliant.

Not sure if you are in the office this week, but if you are, wanted to see if 
you would want to meet for a drink after work today? ";"eckworth-velaw-com";975584950000;0;0;0;0;"gerald-nemec

Ken,

I will be faxing you the December Inside FERC Report.  Amazingly so, Questar 
is at a higher price than NWPL.  Questar is $6.14, NWPL is $6.01.  This price 
is higher than Transco Zn 3, Texas Gas, Columbia Gulf, TETCO, Tenn.....  
incredible.

In joking with Mark Whitt, he made the comment that maybe we should keep 
quiet.

All:

ECS will be signing Christmas cards to send to our customers tomorrow 
afternoon (sorry for the late notice).  You are invited to join in the 
festivities at Slainte Irish Pub (509 Main Street) at 2:30pm.  Grinches need 
not attend, as much merriment will abound.  Come early or come late  -  hope 
to see you there!

We will not be settling the El Paso/Stingray imbalance.  El Paso insists on

imbalance occurred.  We'll just carry the imbalance on our books.  Maybe 
we'll pay it back next year.

Please confirm...I'm still confused.  So you're coming, right?  You would

her husbands.  Since her family is from the hills of West Virginia and her 
husbands is from the swamps of Louisiana, she always has funny stories.

What did you charge $1,000 for?  I haven't gotten anywhere on my 
accomplishments.  Right after I emailed you we discovered some major issues 
with the basis report, so it looks like I'll be doing accomplishments 
tonight.  I'm still hoping I can come to your game though.  It doesn't start 
until 8:45 right?

Gossett officially asked me for my accomplishments today.  I have to have 
them done by tomorrow night.  So I guess that's what I'll be doing the rest 
of the day(not that I've had that many accomplishments just that it'll take 
me that long to think of something.)  I knew I might as well add that last 
crack b/c if I didn't you would have!

Hey Robin,

I think your NGMR/AECO/C equiv factors are still out. I checked May 02 and 
July 02 and they both have 0.80, whereas it should have 1.00. Please see the

detail, but only asked for total gas volumes moved.  As a first cut, let's go 
back with total volumes in 1999 and 2000 (broken out separately).  They may 
come back wanting more detail, but this will serve as a start.

Thanks,

Gents,

I have created and populated the due diligence folders in Livelink for the 
1999 Peakers.  Attached are the slimmed-down indexes of the documents that 
were moved.  We'll need to go through these documents to find the redactions.

The models reflects 10 years on the revenue forecast.  The DASH reflects 
Mitch's changes from Wednesday.  We will talk later.  

Issues to consider:
1)  Payback year shifts back to 3 years from 2.5 years when considering taxes 
and dep.
2)  IRR increases from 27% to 29% with 10 yr forecast
3)  Balance sheet still out of balance

Hi

Give me a call about Duke's changes.  I also disagree w (ii) and really think 
even (i) is wrong since an Option can either be in the money or out of the

other Gains and Losses.

  How about Tuesday at 1130 ( I'm meeting with all Enron power traders on

If that doesn't work I can also play on Wed.

I must agree with Mary, the governance structure in the WIO is fundimentally 
flawed and only sets up a board that fights to a stalemate end game.  This 
board should had been independent and Marys right.  that's my 2 cents.

Just a reminder that when entering a wheel, the Interchange ID must be the same for the import and export.  When the Import is labeled as EPMI_CISO_** and the Export as CISO_EPMI_**, the ISO views these as unique imports and exports.

and modify it as you see fit for the Paper World?

Many thanks,

Lucy

P.S.
This particular deal is for a paper DRAFT, but I thought  we should have the 
template in place anyway.  For future deals of course.

According ot Financial Settlements, the City of Dublin transaction that I 
told you could have some legal risk because it is a municipality, was 
actually the trigger to a physical transaction.  I asked if they could book 
this in the system as a Physical Swap so we show no financial exposure.

Jeff -- 

Is there an extra space on 33 for me?    Some of the business folks have 
asked that I move closer to them.

Please let me know what you think.

Stewart,

	I went over Murray's spreadsheet for the CDWR allocation and found some numbers that don't make since to me. I will talk to Murray the moment he walks in the door and get this e-mail to CDWR before 9:00am. There is an adjustment made to the multiplier for CDWR that is specific to only them as a counterparty.

Hey Kate,

   Hope work is going alright this afternoon.  Don't look out the window, it 
kind of got nice out.  I think we are all going to be downtown this 
afternoon, so call one of us to meet up if you want.  I'm enclosing my 
resume, see what you can do.  I would really appreciate any help you could 
give me.

Thanks,
